## Configuration file for CAVA. Default values are commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting.


[general]

# smoothing mode, can be normal, scientific or waves.
 mode = normal

# Framerate Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
 framerate = 60

# Sensitivity in  %. If you think the bars are to low/response is to littei, try
# increasing this value 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
 sensitivity = 5

# Autosens will atempt to decrease sensitivity if cava peaks. 1 = on, 0 = off
 autosens = 1

# The number of bars. 0 (default) sets it to auto (fil upp console).
# width of bras and space between bars in number of characters. Default witdth 3 and space 1.
 bars = 0
 bar_width = 1
 bar_spacing = 0


# Lower cutoff freq for lowest bar and higheset for highest bar
# the bandwith of the visualizer, defaults to 50 - 10000 Hz
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwith of 43Mhz x number of bars.
# Cava will automaticly increase the higher cuttoff if a too low band is specified.
lower_cutoff_freq = 40
higher_cutoff_freq = 10000



[input]

# method of capturing audio, supported input methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'alsa'
#
# for pulseaudio 'source' wil be the source. Default: 'NULL', which uses system default source
# all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them
# but the default, might be your microphone, try the command 'pacmd list-sources' to find the right one
# you can change source here to the name of your prefered device, or cahnge your default pulseaudio source by running
# 'pacmd set-default-source NAME|#N'
#
# for alsa 'source' will be the capture device. Default: 'hw:Loopback,1'
# for fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file. Default: '/tmp/mpd.fifo'
; method = alsa
; source = hw:Loopback,1

; method = fifo
; source = /tmp/mpd.fifo

 method = pulse

[output]

# method used to draw output may be ncurses, noncurses.
 method = ncurses

# visual styles, may be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# Stereo mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# Mono avrages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies
 style = stereo


[color]

# supported colors are: red, green, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, blue, black.
; background = black
 foreground = white


[smoothing]

# multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; integral = 0.5

# disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable.
 monstercat = 1

# Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
 gravity = 0


# In bar height, bars that whould have been lower that this will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0


[eq]
#
# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
 1 = 5 # bass
 2 = 4
 3 = 4

 5 = 3 # midtone
 6 = 1.5
